## Homework for TeachMeSkills - Java Lesson #4 (One-dimensional arrays)

For all tasks, the initial conditions are as follows: the user enters the array size (just an integer) from the keyboard. After the array size is set, it is filled in one of two ways: using `Math.random()`, or each element of the array is manually entered by the user. Try both options. After filling the array with data, solve the following problems for it.

### Task #1

Iterate through the array, outputting all elements in forward and backward order.

### Task #2

Find the minimum-maximum elements and print them to the console.

### Task #3

Find the indices of the minimum and maximum elements and print them to the console.

### Task #4

Find and print the number of null elements. If there are no zero elements, print a message that there are none.

### Task #5

Iterate through the array, swapping the first and last elements, the second and penultimate elements, and so on.

### Task #6

Check if the array is an increasing sequence (each next number is greater than the previous one).
