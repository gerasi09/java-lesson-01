## Homework for TeachMeSkills - Java Lesson #1

### Task #1

Write an application that calculates and displays a value using the formula
`a=4*(b+c-1)/2`, where `b` and `c` are set independently in the code.

### Task #2

A two-digit number is stored in the variable `n`. Write a program that calculates and displays the sum of the digits of n.
the sum of the digits of `n`. For example: `n = 26`, as a result we should get `8` (2 + 6 = 8).

### Task #3

A three-digit number is stored in the variable `n`. Write a program that calculates and displays the sum of the digits of n.
the sum of the digits of `n`. For example: `n = 126`, the result should be `9` ( 1 + 2 + 6 = 9).

### Task #4

The variable `n` stores a real number with a non-zero fractional part. Write a program that rounds the number `n` to the nearest integer and displays the result on the screen.

### Task #5

The variables `q` and w hold two natural numbers. Write a program that displays the result of dividing `q` by `w` with a remainder. Example of program output (for the case where `q` stores `21` and `w` stores `8`) `21 / 8 = 2` and `5` in the remainder.

### Task #6

Write a program that stores the values of integer variables.
Example:
```java
int a = 1;
int b = 2;
//code (your solution)
sout(a); //shows 2
sout(b); //shows 1
```
