## Homework for TeachMeSkills - Java Lesson #9

Create a logically correct hierarchy of the following classes: `Animal`, `Dog`, `Tiger`, `Rabbit`.
Override the `voice()`, `eat(String food)` methods so that they output the correct
information. The eat method can accept `"Meat"`, `"Grass"` and other strings.
For example, if we create an object of `Rabbit` class, call the `eat()` method and pass
`"Grass"` to it, it should write in the console that it likes to eat grass. If we pass `"Meat"`
or any other string, he's not going to be happy.
